# Code-Mixing-Translator

<h1> ABSTRACT </h1>
  <p>In the present world different people speak different languages. Learning and understanding each language is difficult as well as time consuming.
So, in-order to solve this problem we are having language translator apps.
Most translators that we find on web are used to translate one language to another, then what if a person speaks a bilingual conversation…? It translates one language and leaves the unrecognized words unchanged.For example, take google translator, if we give input as ‘I can make delicious biryani’ this can be translated to any other preferred language like Telugu, Hindi, Marathi, etc. But if give the input as ‘I can make manchi biryani’, (where ‘I can make’ are English words and ‘manchi’ is a Telugu word) the google translator will translate the English words but it cannot translate the Telugu word give which is ‘manchi’. It gives error or it just remain the word ‘manchi’ as it is without translation.</p><br>
<p>This problem occurs while translating a real-time conversation as we use words of different languages when we speak. So, to solve this problem, we came up with a solution.</p>
